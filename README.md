# Musical Instrument Recognition using the Scattering Transform

This repository serves as an archive for my past work on [my masters thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1474357&dswid=-4372). 

I've made the repository public for those who are interested or looking to reproduce the results. Please note that the notebooks may not work seamlessly out of the box, as I didn't create a requirements.txt/makefile for the dependencies. However, with a bit of effort, you should be able to get them up and running.
