# Musical Instrument Recognition using the Scattering Transform

This repository serves as an archive for my past work on [my masters thesis]([https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-310&pid=diva2%3A1466885&c=2&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=carl+nystr%C3%B6mer&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1474357&dswid=-4372)https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1474357&dswid=-4372). 

I've made the repository public for those who are interested or looking to reproduce the results. Please note that the notebooks may not work seamlessly out of the box, as I didn't create a requirements.txt/makefile for the dependencies. However, with a bit of effort, you should be able to get them up and running.
